# Heaven as Wide as Questions, Hell as Deep as Bugs  
*(A Software Engineer’s Code Review of the Quran)*

## 📜 Project Introduction
This project is an analytical article that examines the Quranic text from the perspective of a software engineer.  
Using software engineering concepts such as **System Architecture**, **Debugging**, **Legacy Code**, and **User Experience**, it analyzes the structure, internal consistency, and user experience of the "Revelation System."

The text is not intended as absolute denial or confirmation, but rather as an **intellectual code review** — an invitation to reflection, questioning, and structured thinking about a text that has inspired humanity for centuries.
